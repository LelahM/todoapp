# GetTasked Privacy Implementation Summary

## 🔒 Privacy Features Implemented

### Individual User Sessions
- Each user now gets a unique session ID using UUID
- Tasks are stored per session, completely isolated from other users
- No shared data between different users

### Session-Based Storage
- User data is stored in Flask sessions (server-side secure storage)
- Each user's tasks are stored with a unique key: `tasks_{user_id}`
- User names are also stored per session: `user_name`
- **NEW**: Sessions now persist for 31 days, even if browser tab is closed

### Data Persistence
- Sessions marked as permanent to survive browser restarts
- Flask-Session extension used for filesystem storage
- Data remains private but accessible when you return to the app
- No need to re-enter your tasks after closing the browser

### Data Isolation
- `get_user_id()`: Creates or retrieves unique user ID for each session
- `get_user_tasks()`: Returns only tasks belonging to current user
- `save_user_tasks()`: Saves tasks only for current user session

### Privacy Controls
- **Clear My Data** button allows users to delete all their personal data
- Privacy indicator shows users their session is secure
- No data persistence across deployments (adds security)

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app_private.py`: Main private application with session isolation
- `templates/index_private.html`: Template with privacy indicators
- `index_private.py`: Alternative Vercel entry point for private version
- `vercel_private.json`: Vercel config for private deployment

### Modified Files
- `index.py`: Updated to use private version
- `README.md`: Updated with privacy documentation

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is now deployed with privacy features:
- **Live URL**: https://gettasked.vercel.app
- **Privacy**: Each user gets isolated data storage
- **Security**: No data sharing between users

## 🔐 How Privacy Works

1. **User Visits App**: Unique session ID is generated
2. **Data Storage**: All tasks are stored with user's session ID
3. **Data Retrieval**: Only tasks for current session are shown
4. **Isolation**: Other users cannot access your data
5. **Control**: Users can clear their data anytime
